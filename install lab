To deploy Splunk Enterprise on six Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 servers—comprising a search head cluster (3 nodes), an indexer cluster (2 nodes), and a utility server (acting as both cluster manager and deployer)—follow this comprehensive step-by-step guide.

**1. Prepare the Linux Machines**

Before installing Splunk, ensure each server is properly prepared:

- **Create the 'splunk' User:**
  ```bash
  sudo useradd -m splunk
  sudo passwd splunk
  ```
  This creates a new user named 'splunk' and sets its password.

- **Set Appropriate Permissions:**
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /opt/splunk
  sudo chown -R splunk:splunk /opt/splunk
  ```
  This ensures the 'splunk' user has ownership of the installation directory.

**2. Install Splunk Enterprise**

Download the Splunk Enterprise RPM package suitable for RHEL 9 from the [Splunk Downloads page](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html).

- **Transfer the RPM Package to Each Server:**
  Use `scp` or another secure method to copy the RPM package to each server.

- **Install the RPM Package:**
  ```bash
  sudo rpm -i /path/to/splunk_package_name.rpm
  ```
  This installs Splunk Enterprise into the default directory `/opt/splunk`.

**3. Configure the Utility Server**

The utility server will function as both the cluster manager for the indexer cluster and the deployer for the search head cluster.

- **Set Up the Cluster Manager:**
  ```bash
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk edit cluster-config -mode manager -replication_factor 2 -secret <your_secret_key> -auth admin:changeme
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart
  ```
  This configures the server as the cluster manager with a replication factor of 2.

- **Set Up the Deployer:**
  Edit the `server.conf` file to set the security key for the search head cluster:
  ```bash
  sudo -u splunk vi /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/server.conf
  ```
  Add the following under the `[shclustering]` stanza:
  ```
  [shclustering]
  pass4SymmKey = <your_shcluster_key>
  ```
  Restart Splunk to apply changes:
  ```bash
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart
  ```

**4. Configure the Indexer Cluster**

On each of the two indexer nodes:

- **Initialize as Peer Nodes:**
  ```bash
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk edit cluster-config -mode peer -manager_uri https://<utility_server_ip>:8089 -replication_port 9887 -secret <your_secret_key> -auth admin:changeme
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart
  ```
  This configures each indexer to communicate with the cluster manager.

**5. Configure the Search Head Cluster**

On each of the three search head nodes:

- **Initialize as Search Head Cluster Members:**
  ```bash
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk init shcluster-config -mgmt_uri https://<search_head_ip>:8089 -replication_port 9887 -conf_deploy_fetch_url https://<utility_server_ip>:8089 -secret <your_shcluster_key> -shcluster_label shcluster1 -auth admin:changeme
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart
  ```
  This sets up each search head as a member of the search head cluster.

- **Bootstrap the Search Head Cluster:**
  On one of the search heads, run:
  ```bash
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk bootstrap shcluster-captain -servers_list "https://<sh1_ip>:8089,https://<sh2_ip>:8089,https://<sh3_ip>:8089" -auth admin:changeme
  ```
  This designates the initial captain for the search head cluster.

**6. Integrate Search Head Cluster with Indexer Cluster**

On each search head node:

- **Configure as Search Heads for the Indexer Cluster:**
  ```bash
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk edit cluster-config -mode searchhead -manager_uri https://<utility_server_ip>:8089 -secret <your_secret_key> -auth admin:changeme
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart
  ```
  This connects the search head cluster to the indexer cluster.

**7. Deploy Apps and Configurations**

Use the deployer on the utility server to distribute apps and configurations to the search head cluster:

- **Distribute Configurations:**
  Place the desired apps or configurations in `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/shcluster/apps/` on the deployer.
  Then, run:
  ```bash
  sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk apply shcluster-bundle -target https://<search_head_ip>:8089 -auth admin:changeme
  ```
  This deploys the configurations to all search head cluster members.

**8. Finalize the Deployment**

Ensure all components are communicating correctly:

- **Verify Cluster Status:
